Node.js is a powerful and versatile open-source platform that utilizes JavaScript for server-side scripting. Unlike traditional web development environments, where JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting within the browser, Node.js extends its capabilities to the server side. This allows developers to use JavaScript for building scalable and high-performance network applications.Node.js leverages the V8 JavaScript runtime engine developed by Google, providing fast execution of code. Its package manager, npm (Node Package Manager), is one of the largest ecosystems of open-source libraries, enabling developers to easily integrate pre-built modules into their projects.As a result of these features, Node.js has gained widespread popularity in the development community. It has become a go-to choice for building server-side applications and APIs, contributing to the growth of JavaScript as a full-stack language. Whether used for building RESTful APIs, microservices, or real-time applications, Node.js has proven to be a valuable platform for modern web development.
